Experiment 3

Expected Behavior:
- RR: Alternates all runnable processes equally.
- RRSP: Same as RR if nice is equal.
- MLFQ: Favors interactive tasks (they remain in higher queues; CPU-bound tasks get demoted).

Observed RR:
running 4 at 104
running 5 at 105
running 6 at 108
running 7 at 108
...
CPU-bound finish first; interactive tasks finish later.
No special preference.

Observed RRSP:
Same pattern as RR (equal nice → equal priority).

Observed MLFQ:
(MLFQ not booting; expected behavior: interactive tasks run more often because they block and stay in higher queues.)

Conclusion:
RR and RRSP do not favor interactive workloads.  
MLFQ is expected to demonstrate interactive preference once functioning.
