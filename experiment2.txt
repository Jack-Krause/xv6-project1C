Experiment 2

Expected Behavior:
- RR: Ignores nice → all tasks run equally.
- RRSP: Strict priority → high-priority tasks run first and finish before low-priority ones.
- MLFQ: Priority influenced by behavior; nice may affect initial queue but not strict like RRSP.

Observed RR:
running 4 at 27
running 5 at 28
running 6 at 29
running 7 at 30
(all start equally)
→ RR ignores nice as expected.

Observed RRSP:
running 4 at 39
running 5 at 40
running 4 at 41
running 5 at 42
...
(high-priority PIDs run exclusively)
→ low-priority tasks only run after 4 and 5 finish.

Observed MLFQ:
(MLFQ not booting; expected behavior is partial preference, not strict starvation.)

Conclusion:
RR shows no priority behavior.  
RRSP shows strict enforcement of nice.  
MLFQ (expected): not strictly static like RRSP; avoids starvation but prefers higher queues.
