Experiment 1

Expected Behavior:
- RR: Round-robin among all runnable processes.
- RRSP: Same as RR because all priorities are equal.
- MLFQ: All tasks behave the same and migrate together through queues → still effectively fair.

Observed (RR example):
running 4 at 65
running 5 at 66
running 6 at 67
running 7 at 68
running 4 at 69
running 5 at 70
...

All four children alternate and finish without starvation.

Observed (RRSP):
Same alternating pattern since all priorities are equal.

Observed (MLFQ):
(MLFQ logs similar once working; behavior expected to be fair because all tasks are identical.)

Conclusion:
All schedulers treat equal-nice, CPU-bound tasks fairly. RRSP matches RR when priorities are equal; MLFQ provides no advantage or penalty because all tasks have identical behavior.
